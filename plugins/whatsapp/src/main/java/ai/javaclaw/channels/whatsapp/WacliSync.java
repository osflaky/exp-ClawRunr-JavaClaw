/**
 * Keeps the long-running {@code wacli sync} subprocess alive. One scheduled thread runs it, waits
 * a moment once it dies, and runs it again -- giving up only after {@link #MAX_RESTART_RETRIES}
 * failures in quick succession.
 *
 * <p>"In quick succession" is what {@code healthyUptime} decides: a run that stayed up that long
 * counts as a fresh problem rather than another one in the same burst. Without it the retry limit
 * would be a lifetime count, and a subprocess that dies once a week -- which is normal, WhatsApp
 * Web sessions drop -- would switch the channel off for good after five weeks.
 *
 * <p>Starting the process and both durations are passed in, so this class is only about staying
 * alive and tests can drive the restarts without really waiting.
 *
 * <p>Several threads meet here: Spring's startup and shutdown call {@link #start} and
 * {@link #stop}, the subprocess is watched on the "wacli-sync" thread, and any thread sending a
 * message asks {@link #isRunning} first -- hence the {@code volatile} fields.
